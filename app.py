This will determine the html page to display based on file linked to the name of the page. So if we have an 
html file for women.html, we will create a path to it --> "@app.route('/women')" where "/women" is our path.

If you wanted to append another path to the end of an existing path (a slug), then just change the path by 
appending the name of the html file to the main subdirectory. So if we have an html file for women-shoes.html, 
we will create a path --> "@app.route('/women/women-shoes')" where "/women/women-shoes" is our path

Additionally, this is where we can manipulate our table based on the page the user is currently in.
